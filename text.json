That&#39;s not what happened, though. They already know how to interact with consequences, they just knew that the fake-money games didn&#39;t have them so they focused on fun and altruism instead. The moment consequences came in, they changed their strategies.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo which world would you rather live in? One where the stakes are non-existent and it&#39;s more important to freely help your fellow man when their struggling so you can keep on enjoying life with them? Or one where a &quot;reward&quot; as low as $20 imposed by someone in power is enough to make everyone frugal and ruthless? What world do you want to teach kids is the ideal one to strive for?",
            "textOriginal": "Sounds like this isn't an experiment about teaching financial literacy, but about adding artificial consequences. If it were about teaching financial literacy, I'd expect the first monopoly game with real money would proceed exactly as the fake money games, since the kids haven't learned the skills yet. That's not what happened, though. They already know how to interact with consequences, they just knew that the fake-money games didn't have them so they focused on fun and altruism instead. The moment consequences came in, they changed their strategies.\n\nSo which world would you rather live in? One where the stakes are non-existent and it's more important to freely help your fellow man when their struggling so you can keep on enjoying life with them? Or one where a \"reward\" as low as $20 imposed by someone in power is enough to make everyone frugal and ruthless? What world do you want to teach kids is the ideal one to strive for?",
